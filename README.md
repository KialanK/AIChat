Make sure you use a model wich can process pictures like ```gpt-4o-mini``` if you have used the mod before the latest version, you have to change your model from ```gpt-3.5-turbo``` to ```gpt-4o-mini```.

Make sure you have some **funds in your OpenAI account**. The default model (```gpt-4o-mini```) doesnâ€™t really require any money, but you still need a minimum balance of $0.01 to use the API. You can add funds to your account [here](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview)

### Configuration
___

If you want to use a model other than ```gpt-4o-mini``` (e.g., ```gpt-4o```), you can configure it by changing the name of the model in the config screen or you type ```/config AI_MODEL <AI model you want to use>```. Keep in mind that better models are also more expensive. You can view all available models [here](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits).
